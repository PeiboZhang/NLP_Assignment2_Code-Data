# NLP_Assignment2_Code-Data

This repository contains datasets, main analysis, and models for the NLP Assignment 2.

# Datasets
- Training Dataset: fallreports_2023-9-21_train.csv
- Test Dataset: fallreports_2023-9-21_test.csv

# Analysis and Models
- Main Analysis: A2_FullAnalysis.py
    As described in sections 3 and 4 of the report.
- Corrected SVM Model: A2_SVM_CorrectedCV.py
    As mentioned in section 4.2 of the report.
- BiLSTM Model Attempt: A2_BiLSTM model.py
   This was an experimental attempt at hyper-tuning and training the BiLSTM model. I incorporated some procedures not yet discussed in class. As a result, the outcomes of this model were not included in the main paper but are provided here for potential future reference.
